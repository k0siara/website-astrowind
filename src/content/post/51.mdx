First of all, Happy New Year everyone! Here's to hoping 2025 brings you even more joy and success than the last year.

There seems to be a huge wave of motivation in the air this year. The gyms are packed, social media is buzzing with "this is YOUR year" messages, and I've already received a few iOS mentoring requests from young mobile developers. It's interesting to see so many people taking active steps toward their goals.
