title: 'Make sure to update your StateFlow safely in Kotlin!'
excerpt: StateFlow is a common choice for storing app state in Android, e.g., view state. But do you know how to use it correctly?

import CallToAction from '~/components/widgets/CallToAction.astro';

Recently a new version of Kotlin Coroutines library was released with a few new extensions functions to help you with StateFlow updates. It all started with this issue:

https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/issues/2720

Let‚Äôs see what it‚Äôs all about‚Ä¶ üëá

## StateFlow

StateFlow is mostly used for handling state and state updates. It can be used for example in Android‚Äôs ViewModel to expose state to your views.

Let‚Äôs see an example:

```kotlin
class ExampleViewModel(
    private val initialState: ExampleViewState
) : ViewModel() {
    private val _uiState: MutableStateFlow<ExampleViewState> = MutableStateFlow(initialState)
    val uiState = _uiState.asStateFlow()
}

data class ExampleViewState(
    val title: String = "",
    val description: String = ""
    // other state variables
)
```


### How to update the state?

Well, it‚Äôs really easy, since we use a data class. We can just use copy like this:

```kotlin
_uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(title = "Something")
```

Simple, right? But you have to be careful‚Ä¶

## Where's the catch?

So what‚Äôs the problem? While the code is very simple, there is something you have to be aware of - **concurrency**.

If between the time copy function completes and the StateFlow‚Äôs new value is emitted another thread tries to update the StateFlow ‚Äî by using copy and updating one of the properties that the current copy isn‚Äôt modifying ‚Äîwe could end up with results we were not expecting.

<CallToAction
    actions={[{
      variant: "primary",
      text: 'Do≈ÇƒÖczam za darmo! üöÄ',
      href: 'https://mobiledevnews.com',
      target: '_blank',
    }]}

  />

## The solution

How do we solve this problem? By using fresh good stuff from Kotlin Coroutines for MutableStateFlow.

I‚Äôm talking about are these three methods below:
- update
- updateAndGet
- getAndUpdate

All of these take a function parameter that returns the new state that will be emitted.

Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs inside the update method for a moment:

```kotlin
public inline fun <T> MutableStateFlow<T>.update(function: (T) -> T) {
    while (true) {
        val prevValue = value
        val nextValue = function(prevValue)
        if (compareAndSet(prevValue, nextValue)) {
            return
        }    
    }
}
```

As we can see, a function is passed as a param and it‚Äôs applied to the current StateFlow‚Äôs value. Then compareAndSet function is used to determine if the value has changed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor example by another thread. If compareAndSet returns false then the while loop will be running until it‚Äôs possible to update the state.

So how to use it properly?

```kotlin
_uiState.update { it.copy(title = "Something") }
```

That‚Äôs it! This ensures us that the state can be changed safely üëç
